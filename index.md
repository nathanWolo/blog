Hi! Welcome to my blog, this is where I'll be posting about projects I'm working on, as well as my personal thoughts and other random musings.
Lately my focus is mostly on deep learning, where I like to work on independent projects as well as collaborations with UVic AI.

<!-- [Link to another page](./another-page.html). -->

I have a pretty broad range of interests I'm likely to post about, and if you're interested in any of these feel free to hit me up to talk about them.
*   Card games (specifically *Hearthstone* and *Dominion*)
<DD> Though I don't play as much anymore, I was once ranked in the top 50 worldwide in Hearthstone's online ladder
*   Bouldering
*   Scifi / Futurism
<DD> Specifically how we might see a technological singularity in our lifetimes
*   Nuclear power
*   YIMBYism
*   Electoral politics
*   Applied math

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

*   This is an unordered list following a header.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one

1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

The final element.
